# Compose Volumes

Defines named volumes or bind mounts that can be shared across multiple services. Volumes provide persistent storage for data used by containers.

```yaml
volumes:
    data:
        driver: local
```

## Example

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/www/html
      - ./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - /host/path:/container/path
    ports:
      - 80:80

volumes:
  data:
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

In this example, we have a service called `web` running Nginx. Let's break down the volume configurations:

Named Volume `data`: The named volume `data` is created without specifying a driver. This will use the default local driver.

Bind Mount `./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`: This bind mount maps a file from the local host `./config/nginx.conf` to a file inside the container `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. The `:ro` option makes the bind mount `read-only`.

Absolute Path Bind Mount `/host/path:/container/path`: This bind mount maps a directory from the local host `/host/path` to a directory inside the container `/container/path`.

Additionally, we define another named volume db_data with a specific driver (local in this case). This named volume can be used by other services if needed.

## Named Volumes:

Named volumes are a way to create and manage volumes with a user-friendly name. They are defined under the volumes section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Examples

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      MYSQL_USER: myuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: mypassword

volumes:
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

The volumes section under the db service specifies a named volume named `db_data`. This volume is mounted to the `/var/lib/mysql` directory inside the MariaDB container, where MariaDB stores its database files.

## Bind Mounts

Bind mounts link a directory or file on the host machine to a directory in the container. They are useful for quickly sharing code or configuration files between the host and the container.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    volumes:
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      MYSQL_USER: myuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: mypassword

volumes:
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

* An additional bind mount is added under the volumes section for the db service. It maps the local file `./init.sql` to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` inside the MariaDB container. This is a common location where MariaDB looks for initialization scripts during the container startup.
* The `./init.sql` file can contain SQL statements that will be executed when the MariaDB container is first started, allowing you to initialize the database with custom schema or data.

In both examples bind and named, the db_data volume ensures that the MariaDB data persists even if the container is stopped or removed, providing a way to maintain the database state across container restarts. The bind mount, on the other hand, allows you to inject external configuration or initialization files into the container.

## Anonymous Volumes

Anonymous volumes are similar to named volumes, but they don't have an explicit name. Docker automatically generates a unique name for them. They are primarily used when you don't need to share the volume between services.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql
```
## External Volumes

External volumes refer to volumes that are created outside the Docker Compose file. They can be pre-created using `docker volume create` and then referenced in the docker-compose.yml file.

```yaml
volumes:
  data:
    external: true
```

## Tmpfs Mounts

Tmpfs mounts create a temporary filesystem in the host machine's memory and mount it into the container. This type of volume is useful when you want to store data temporarily and don't need persistence.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```
