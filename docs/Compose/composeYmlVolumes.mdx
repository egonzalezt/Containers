# Compose Volumes

Defines named volumes or bind mounts that can be shared across multiple services. Volumes provide persistent storage for data used by containers.

```yaml
volumes:
    data:
        driver: local
```

## Example

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/www/html
      - ./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - /host/path:/container/path
    ports:
      - 80:80

volumes:
  data:
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

In this example, we have a service called `web` running Nginx. Let's break down the volume configurations:

Named Volume `data`: The named volume `data` is created without specifying a driver. This will use the default local driver.

Bind Mount `./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`: This bind mount maps a file from the local host `./config/nginx.conf` to a file inside the container `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. The `:ro` option makes the bind mount `read-only`.

Absolute Path Bind Mount `/host/path:/container/path`: This bind mount maps a directory from the local host `/host/path` to a directory inside the container `/container/path`.

Additionally, we define another named volume db_data with a specific driver (local in this case). This named volume can be used by other services if needed.
