# Compose Networks

Specifies the networks to be created for communication between services. It allows services to communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames.

## Bridge Network

A bridge network is the default network type in Docker Compose. It allows containers to communicate with each other on the same host using their service names as hostnames. Here's an example:

```yaml
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

## Host Network

A host network allows containers to share the host's networking stack, effectively bypassing network isolation. Here's an example:

```yaml
networks:
  default:
    driver: host
```

## Overlay Network

An overlay network allows communication between containers running on different hosts. This is useful for creating distributed and scalable applications. Here's an example:

```yaml
networks:
  app_network:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
```

## Macvlan Network

A Macvlan network allows containers to have their own MAC addresses, making them appear as separate physical devices on the network. Here's an example:

```yaml
networks:
  macvlan_network:
    driver: macvlan
    driver_opts:
      parent: eth0
      mode: bridge
```

## External Network

An external network allows you to connect your containers to an existing network created outside of Docker Compose. This is useful for integrating with other Docker Compose projects or existing infrastructure. Here's an example:

```yaml
networks:
  external_network:
    external:
      name: my_existing_network
```

:::tip
In this example, `my_existing_network` is the name of an external network created by another Docker Compose project or manually using Docker commands.

Note that the availability of network types may vary depending on your Docker installation and configuration.

Remember to replace the network names (`default`, `app_network`, `macvlan_network`, `external_network`) with meaningful names based on your specific use case.

## Manually set Ip addresses

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app1:
    image: nginx:latest
    networks:
      my_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.0.10

  app2:
    image: mysql:latest
    networks:
      my_network:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.0.20

networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 192.168.0.0/24
```

:::note
Remember to adjust the IP addresses, subnet, and service names as needed to match your specific requirements.
