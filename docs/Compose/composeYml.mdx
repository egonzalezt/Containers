# Docker Compose YML

The `docker-compose.yml` file is written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) format and serves as the configuration file for Docker Compose. It defines the services, networks, volumes, and other components required to orchestrate your multi-container application.

## Basic Structure

A typical `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following key components:

### Version
Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format being used. It is recommended to explicitly specify the version to ensure compatibility. For example:

```yaml
version: '3'
```

### Services

Defines the individual services or containers that make up your application. Each service has a unique name and includes details such as the image to use, ports to expose, environment variables, volumes, and network connections. For example:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - 80:80
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=production
    volumes:
      - ./app:/var/www/html
```

### Networks

Specifies the networks to be created for communication between services. It allows services to communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames. For example:

```yaml
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

### Volumes

Defines named volumes or bind mounts that can be shared across multiple services. Volumes provide persistent storage for data used by containers. For example:

```yaml
volumes:
    data:
        driver: local
```

## Additional Configuration Options

In addition to the basic structure, the docker-compose.yml file supports various other configuration options, including:

### Environment Variables

You can specify environment variables for each service to customize its behavior. This can include database credentials, API keys, or any other configuration specific to your application.

```yaml
services:
    api:
        environment:
            - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@db_host/db_name
            - API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Dependencies and Links

You can define dependencies between services or link containers together. This allows you to control the startup order of containers and enables services to communicate with each other.

```yaml
services:
    api:
        depends_on:
            - db
    db:
        image: mysql:latest
```

### Scaling and Replicas

Docker Compose provides the ability to scale services horizontally by specifying the desired number of replicas for a particular service. This allows you to scale your application based on demand.

```yaml
services:
    web:
        image: nginx:latest
        scale: 3
```

### Healthchecks

You can define healthchecks to monitor the health of your services. Healthchecks can be used to ensure that containers are running correctly and ready to accept traffic.

```yaml
services:
    web:
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
            interval: 30s
            timeout: 10s
            retries: 3
```

### Secrets Management

Docker Compose supports integration with Docker Swarm secrets or other secrets management systems to securely manage sensitive information.

```yaml
services:
    api:
        secrets:
            - db_password
secrets:
    db_password:
        external: true
```

### Restart Policies

You can specify the restart policy for your services in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Restart policies define the conditions under which Docker Compose should automatically restart a container if it exits. The following restart policies are available:

#### no 

This is the default restart policy. It means that the container will not be restarted if it exits for any reason.

#### always 

The container will always be restarted regardless of the exit status. This is useful for services that should be running continuously.

#### on-failure

The container will be restarted only if it exits with a non-zero exit code. You can also specify the maximum number of restart attempts using the restart configuration option.

#### unless-stopped

The container will be restarted unless it is explicitly stopped by the user. This is useful for long-running services that should be automatically restarted if the system reboots.

#### Example

```yaml
services:
    web:
        image: nginx:latest
        restart: always
```

### Resource Limitations

Resource limitations refer to controlling and restricting the amount of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth) allocated to a process or container. These limitations are set to ensure fair resource distribution, prevent resource monopolization, and maintain system stability.

In the context of Docker containers, resource limitations are crucial for managing containerized applications efficiently and preventing them from impacting the overall system's performance. Docker provides several mechanisms to set resource limits for containers, including:

#### CPU Limit

It restricts the amount of CPU usage available to a container. By setting CPU limits, you can prevent a container from consuming excessive CPU resources and ensure fair distribution among other containers and processes.

#### Memory Limit

It defines the maximum amount of memory that a container can use. Setting memory limits helps prevent a container from exhausting the system's available memory, which could lead to performance degradation or crashes.

#### Disk I/O Limit

Docker allows you to limit the rate of disk I/O operations performed by a container. This helps prevent a container from overwhelming the underlying storage system and affecting other containers or processes that share the same resources.

#### Network Bandwidth Limit

You can restrict the network bandwidth usage of a container. This is particularly useful when you want to allocate a specific amount of network bandwidth to a container or prevent it from saturating the network connection.

#### Example

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  my-container:
    image: my-image:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
          blkio_weight: 500
          devices:
            - '/dev/sda:/dev/xvda:rwm'
          reservations:
            devices:
              - '/dev/sdb:/dev/xvdb:rwm'
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.3'
          memory: 256M
    networks:
      - my-network

networks:
  my-network:
```

* cpus: '0.5': Restricts the container to use a maximum of 0.5 CPU cores.

* memory: 512M: Sets a memory limit of 512 megabytes for the container.

* blkio_weight: 500: Defines the block I/O weight for the container, giving it a relative weight of 500 compared to other containers.

* devices: Mounts the /dev/sda device inside the container as /dev/xvda with read-write access.

* reservations.devices: Reserves the /dev/sdb device and mounts it as /dev/xvdb with read-write access.

* reservations.cpus: '0.3': Reserves a minimum of 0.3 CPU cores for the container.

* reservations.memory: 256M: Reserves a minimum of 256 megabytes of memory for the container.

:::note
Note that the resource limits are defined within the `resources` section under the `deploy` key for the service. You can adjust the values according to your specific requirements.
