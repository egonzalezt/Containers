# Intro

## What are Docker Volumes?

Docker volumes provide a way to store and manage persistent data generated by Docker containers. By default, any data stored inside a container is not persisted when the container is stopped or removed. Docker volumes solve this problem by allowing you to create storage that persists even if the containers using them are removed.

Volumes are useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:

- Sharing data between containers
- Persisting application data across container restarts
- Facilitating easy backup and restore of data

## Types of Docker Volumes

Docker provides different types of volumes, including:

- **Named Volumes:** These are volumes with a user-defined name that can be easily referenced and shared across multiple containers.

- **Anonymous Volumes:** These are volumes with an auto-generated, random name that is managed by Docker. Anonymous volumes are typically used for temporary or transient data.

- **Host-mounted Volumes:** These volumes map a directory or file on the host machine to the container. They allow you to directly access and modify data on the host.
