# Dockerfile commands

This guide will walk you through the steps to download an existing Docker image, build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, and run a container using Docker. It will also provide an overview of the arguments used during the build and run processes.

## Downloading an Image

To download an existing Docker image from a container registry (such as Docker Hub), use the following command:

```bash
docker pull image-name:tag
```

Replace `image-name` with the name of the image you want to download and `tag` with the specific version or tag you wish to use.

for example if i want to download the latest nginx image this is the command: `docker pull nginx:latest`. Visit [Nginx Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/tags)

## Building a Docker Image

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, follow these steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile in your project directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory containing the Dockerfile.
3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t image-name:tag .
```

Replace `image-name` with the desired name for your image and `tag` with the version or tag you want to assign.

During the build process, you can use various arguments in the Dockerfile to customize the image. Some common arguments include:

- `ARG`: Defines a variable that can be passed at build-time using the `--build-arg` flag.
- `ENV`: Sets environment variables within the image.
- `RUN`: Executes commands during the build process.
- `COPY` and `ADD`: Copies files or directories from the host machine to the image.

Another flags

- `-t` or `--tag`: Specifies the name and optionally a tag for the image in the name:tag format. For example: `docker build -t my-image:latest .`
- `-f` or `--file`: Specifies the name of the `Dockerfile` to use. By default, Docker looks for a file named Dockerfile in the build context, but you can specify a different filename using this flag. For example: `docker build -f my-dockerfile .`
- `--no-cache`: Forces Docker to build the image from scratch, ignoring any cached layers. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the build process fetches the latest dependencies or if you encountered issues with a previous build. For example: `docker build --no-cache .`
- `--pull`: Forces Docker to always attempt to pull the latest version of the base image before starting the build. This ensures that you are using the most up-to-date base image. For example: `docker build --pull .`
- `--target`: Specifies the target build stage in a multi-stage Dockerfile. You can use this flag to build only a specific stage instead of the entire Dockerfile. For example: `docker build --target my-stage .`

Example on our nginx container: 

```bash
docker build -t nginx-docker .
```

## Running a Docker Container

To run a Docker container using the built image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] image-name:tag
```

Replace `image-name` with the name of the image you built, and `tag` with the specific version or tag you assigned.

During the container runtime, you can provide additional arguments to customize the container behavior. Some common options include:

- `-p` or `--publish`: Publishes container ports to the host machine.
- `-v` or `--volume`: Mounts a host directory or a named volume into the container.
- `-e` or `--env`: Sets environment variables for the container.
- `-d` or `--detach`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `--name`: To set a custom name for your Docker container

Example on our nginx container: 

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 nginx-docker
```

# Managing Docker Containers

Once you have a Docker container running, you can use various commands to manage and interact with it.

## View Running Containers

To see the list of running containers, you can use the `docker ps` command:

```bash
docker ps [OPTIONS]
```

Some useful options for `docker ps` include:

- `-a` or `--all`: Show all containers (including stopped ones).
- `-q` or `--quiet`: Only display container IDs.

## View Container Logs

To view the logs generated by a running container, you can use the docker logs command followed by the container's ID or name:

```bash
docker logs [OPTIONS] container-id
```

Common options for docker logs include:

- `-f` or `--follow`: Follow the log output in real-time.
- `--tail`: Show only the last n lines of logs.

## Execute Commands Inside a Container

To run commands inside a running container, you can use the `docker exec` command:

```bash
docker exec [OPTIONS] container-id command
```

For example, to open a shell inside a container:

```bash
docker exec -it container-id sh
```

another example on our nginx container:

```bash
docker exec -it nginx-docker /bin/bash
```

Options for docker exec include:

- `-i` or `--interactive`: Keep STDIN open even if not attached.
- `-t` or `--tty`: Allocate a pseudo-TTY.

## Monitor Container Resource Usage

To monitor resource usage of running containers, you can use the `docker stats` command:

```bash
docker stats [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER...]
```

By default, `docker stats` displays a live stream of resource usage for all running containers. You can specify container names or IDs to monitor specific containers.

Some useful options for `docker stats` include:

- `--all`: Show statistics for all containers, including stopped ones.
- `--format`: Customize the output format using Go templates.

Refer to the oficial Docker documentation for a complete list of available options and arguments.

Happy Dockerizing!
